/*
You just returned from a trip to South America. The countries you visited were Colombia, Brazil, and Peru. You arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these three countries.

Piggy Bank
Write a 
C++

 program called currency.cpp that prompts the user for the amount of each foreign currency. Your prompts should look like:

Enter number of Colombian Pesos:
Enter number of Brazilian Reais:
Enter number of Peruvian Soles:


Your program should then convert the amount entered by the user and display the total amount of USD. Your final output should look like:

US Dollars = $______
